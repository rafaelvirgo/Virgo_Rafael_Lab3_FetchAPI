1. What are the main differences between XMLHttpRequest and Fetch API? 

The difference between this two is XMLHttpRequest (XHR): older, uses callbacks, more complex syntax. Fetch API: newer, uses Promises, simpler and cleaner to write.

2. Why is the Fetch API considered more modern and readable?

Fetch API is more modern and readable because it uses Promises and async/await, making code easier to understand and manage than nested XHR callbacks.
 
3. What is the purpose of the .then() and .catch() methods in Fetch?
 
.then() handles the successful response, while .catch() handles errors that occur during the request.

4. What happens when you send a POST request to the placeholder API?

When you send a POST request to the placeholder API, it doesn’t actually create data on a real server — it just returns a fake JSON response with the data you sent (useful for testing).
